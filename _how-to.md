### Steps to have the app running on your local server

1. Fork and clone the repository. (Also star this repo if you like)
2. Open Terminal in the cloned directory and hit `npm i`. Install [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it already.
3. After the above step, you'll see a newly created directory /node_modules. You are now ready to run the web-app on your device.
   For that, you need to have connection access to the database. Contact me at [coding.ayush@gmail.com](mailto:coding.ayush@gmail.com) for credentials.
4. After completing the above steps, run `npm start` in the terminal window. Wait for a few minutes until you see the message `Server started successfully on 127.0.0.1:3000`
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:3000` and fall in love with the website ❤️.
