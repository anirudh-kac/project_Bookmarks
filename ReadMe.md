A personal space online for storing and reading books!

- Project Insight:
  This project is focused on building an online personal bookshelf for the community to make reading a bit more elegant.
  I am using the free mongo cluster, so it isn't possible to store entire books online. Therefore, the users will have to
  upload the files as pdf in drive / dropbox and link them in.
