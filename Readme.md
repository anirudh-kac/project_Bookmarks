> A personal space online for storing and reading books!

## ❓ what is it?

This project is focused on building an online personal bookshelf for the community to make reading a bit more elegant. I am using the free mongo cluster, so it isn't possible to store entire books online. Therefore, the users will have to upload the files as pdf in drive / dropbox and link them in.

## 💻 project development:
  - Backend: [Node, Express, Mongo DB]
  - Frontend: [EJS, CSS, JS]
  - Development Duration: 30.06.2020 - live

## 📜 usage
  - Fork and clone the repository.
  - Open Terminal in the cloned directory and hit `npm i`. Install [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it already.
  -  After the above step, you'll see a newly created directory /node_modules. You are ready to run the web-app on your device. But before that, you need to create a mongo db and add it to the `server.js` file or use my own DB. Contact me at [coding.ayush@gmail.com](mailto:coding.ayush@gmail.com) for help regarding this.
  - After completing the above steps, run `npm start` in the terminal window. Wait for a few minutes until you see the message `Bibleo started successfully on $PORT`
  - Open your web browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:$PORT` and fall in love with the website ❤️
